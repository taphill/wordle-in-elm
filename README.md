# Elm Template

This a re-creation of [lindsaykwardell/vite-elm-template](https://github.com/lindsaykwardell/vite-elm-template) which adds some extra things I like to get started with. It is a work in progress and will likely change as I learn more about Elm.

## Get Started

```bash
# Clone the template locally, removing the template's Git log
npx degit taphill/vite-elm-template my-elm-app

# Enter the project, install dependencies, and get started!
cd my-elm-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
